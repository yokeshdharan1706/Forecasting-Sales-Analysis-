Retail Product Sales Forecasting
Problem Statement

In the competitive retail industry, accurately predicting future sales is critical for operational and strategic planning. This project focuses on 
forecasting product sales using historical data and various influencing factors such as store type, location, regional characteristics, holidays, and discounts.
The goal is to develop a predictive model to forecast sales for upcoming periods and enable businesses to make informed decisions.

Why Sales Forecasting is Important

Inventory Management: Maintain optimal inventory levels, avoiding overstocking or stockouts.

Financial Planning: Estimate future revenue and allocate resources effectively.

Marketing & Promotions: Plan promotional campaigns based on forecasted demand.

Supply Chain Optimization: Align production and logistics with expected demand.

Strategic Decisions: Support store expansion, market entry, and resource allocation.

Dataset

Source: [Google Drive Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fBQ1PlWMho3kHF9qXrD0McZNfpJIcbrn )

Features:

ID: Unique identifier for each record.

Store_id: Store identifier.

Store_Type: Category of store (e.g., S1, S2).

Location_Type: Location classification (e.g., L1, L2).

Region_Code: Region identifier.

Date: Transaction date.

Holiday: Indicator (1 = Holiday, 0 = Not a holiday).

Discount: Discount offered (Yes/No).

#Order: Number of orders received.

Sales: Total sales amount.



Blocks of the Project
Block 1: Tableau Visualization
Dashboards:

Sales Performance Dashboard

Time series trends (daily/weekly/monthly)

Drill-down: Year → Month → Day

Comparison by Store Type & Location

Bar charts or pie charts for distribution

Regional Sales Analysis

Region-wise sales, orders, average order value

Promotional Impact

Discounts vs Non-discount days (scatter/box plots)

Holiday impact on sales (bar charts)

Forecast Evaluation

Actual vs Forecast (line chart)

Error metrics (RMSE, MAPE) in KPI cards

Filters

Date range, region, store type, holiday, discount

Block 2: EDA & Hypothesis Testing
EDA:

Univariate Analysis: Histograms, boxplots for Sales, Orders

Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots, correlation matrix

Time Series Analysis: Seasonality, trends, cycles

Categorical Analysis: Sales by Store_Type, Location_Type

Missing Value Treatment & Outlier Detection

Hypothesis Testing:

Discount Impact: t-test for discounted vs non-discounted days

Holiday Effect: t-test or ANOVA for holidays vs non-holidays

Sales by Store Type: ANOVA

Regional Variability: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis

Orders vs Sales Correlation: Pearson or Spearman

Block 3: Machine Learning Modeling
Steps:

Data Processing

Missing value handling

Duplicate removal

Feature engineering:

Lag Features: Sales_Lag_1, Sales_Lag_7

Rolling Mean: Sales_Rolling_7

Scaling & encoding categorical variables

Train-Test split (e.g., Jan 2018–May 2019 for train, June–July 2019 for test)

Models

Baseline: Linear Regression

Tree-Based: Random Forest, XGBoost
